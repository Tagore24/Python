CLASS
-A class is basically an object constructor or a blueprint for an object
-purpose:to store data and info
-members of class defines the class
-class is an abstract as well user defined data type
-class cannot be seen to reveal the word but an object can be seen
 
-Identifiable:shape size clr location
-behaviour:move jump start stop

Objects:
objects get their variable and function from the class
objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions to a single entries
the implementation of class is object

INstantiated:
THE_Init_methon is similar to constructors in C++and java.
it is run soo as an object of a class is instantiated.
the method is usefull to do ANY  instialization you want to do with your object.
